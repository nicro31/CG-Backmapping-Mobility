# CG-Backmapping-Mobility

The folder /Coarse-Grain contains force-fields and scripts required to performed the MARTINI Coarse-Grain Molecular Dynamics simulations of PEDOT:Tos, including the simulation of the water evaporation process.

The folder /Backmapping contains force-fields and scripts required to backmap the Coarse-Grained morphologies to All-Atomistic morphologies. Starting Coarse-Grained morphologies and Obtained All-Atomistic morphologies are included in order to check the results.

The folder /LOE-CTP-FRAG contains the code used to calculate the electrical charge carrier mobility. More information can be found in the README file in this folder.

The folder /Scripts contains a few scripts useful to automatize the whole CG-Backmapping-Mobility calculations as well some scripts to calculate XRD patterns.
